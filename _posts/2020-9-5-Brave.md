- Currently we can earn BAT through people who download the browser under our link and keep it for 1 month, usually the browser offers incentives to users which we can auto donate (I do not recommend it since they can put your account under review and ban it) the best thing is that you exchange these Tokens with another content creator and with the Brave Dev which pays you fractions of BAT to see advertising (Up to 5 ads per hour) I prefer to wait for that function to be added as such in the version principal.

- In addition, you can earn a lot of BAT by watching ads displayed randomly when you use
